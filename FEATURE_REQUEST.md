- i think the timing is wrong in the data read sequence.  try this 
  - within ISR
    - ISR should be configured for the falling edge
    - The first action in the IRS should be BUSY goes high
    - cli();
    - delay for 5ms
    - read data
    - write to ring bummer
    - delay for 2ms
    - ACK set
    - delay for 2ms
    - Ack clear
    - delay for 2ms
    - BUSY LOW
    - sei();
  - within parallel controller update
    - busy high
    - if init low
      - busy low
      - delay 100ms
      - busy high
  - nothing else should control the parallel port
