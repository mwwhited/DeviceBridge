- check the timing diagram of a LPT port
- this device should be working as a printer.  the device should report as busy while it is doing anything other than reading from the lpt port.
- update testint to include the hex value of the data lines as well as all of the data control lines for both in and out
- Each component should have a self test that is used by the validate test function
  - one of the steps in the self test should make sure the objects are properly initialized and have no null pointers from required components.
- the serial menu needs the ability to write the current configuration to the eeprom on the arduino
- when the ring buffer is nearly full the lpt port should hold the busy pin high giving time for other devices to write out the content
- devices that require interrupts or dma such as serial and spi should have the ability to force lpt to be busy.  
  - add a lock/unlock to lpt
- create a service locator class that can hold instances of all component objects
  - inject the service locator into each class at construction
  - only allow communication between components though the references on the service locator
- instead of using EEFS use LittleFS for the EEPROM
- serial commands
  - add list {device} commands for listing files devices
  - add get {device} {filename} command for downloading a file from the device over serial
  - add delete {device} {filename} command for removing a file from device
