- watch for the init signal from the parallel port.  
- add debug logic to monitor `/Auto Feed`, `/Initialize` and `/Select In`
- if `/Initialize` is low for 10ms then get ready for a print job.
- suggested timing change
  - monitor init.  if detected low for at least 10ms then enable IRS, pull busy low and set a delay of 100ms
  - the ISR should fill the ring buffer on strobe
    - when a strobe is receive the ISR should old BUSY high, delay for 5ms, read the data, delay for 2ms set the ACK delay 2ms, reset busy to low
  - once the delay trip the busy should be forced high until the next polling period 
  - is no strobes for at least 50ms during 100ms delay then end of print job
- buffer size is a magic number of 512, chunk size is also 512.  they should be moved to configuration
