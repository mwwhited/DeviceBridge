- [x] Research hardware specifications (OSEPP, W25Q128, parallel port)
- [x] Optimize memory usage for Arduino Mega constraints

## Pending Tasks ðŸ”„

### Immediate (High Priority)
- [x] Run successful build verification (`pio run`) âœ… SUCCESS!
- [x] Upload to hardware (`pio run -t upload`) âœ… SUCCESS!  
- [x] Verify basic FreeRTOS startup âœ… LCD shows "Device Bridge Initializing..."
- [ ] Check serial monitor for initialization details (115200 baud)
- [ ] Test OSEPP button response (any button should enter menu)
- [ ] Verify component initialization status via serial output

### Hardware Testing (Medium Priority)  
- [ ] Test parallel port data capture timing (1ms polling)
- [ ] Validate OSEPP button analog readings (0, 144, 329, 504, 741, 1023)
- [ ] Test SD card initialization and file operations
- [ ] Test W25Q128 EEPROM communication and operations
- [ ] Test DS1307 RTC initialization and time setting

### Functionality Testing (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Test file boundary detection logic (2-second timeout)
- [ ] Test storage failover mechanisms (SD â†’ EEPROM â†’ Serial)
- [ ] Test menu system navigation and commands
- [ ] Test display updates and message handling
- [ ] Test system monitoring and error handling

### Integration Testing (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Test end-to-end data capture and storage
- [ ] Test parallel port interrupt handling
- [ ] Test memory usage under load conditions
- [ ] Test system recovery from error conditions
- [ ] Validate timing requirements for real-time capture

### Documentation Updates (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Update README with build and setup instructions
- [ ] Document test procedures and expected results
- [ ] Create user manual for menu system
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures

### Future Enhancements (Backlog)
- [ ] Implement EEPROM file system operations
- [ ] Add USB serial transfer protocol
- [ ] Implement configuration save/restore
- [ ] Add file type detection algorithms
- [ ] Optimize memory usage further if needed
- [ ] Add LED status indicators
- [ ] Implement watchdog timer for reliability

## Development Notes

### Current Status
Project has been successfully converted to FreeRTOS architecture with all major compilation errors resolved. Ready for build testing and hardware validation.

### Key Constraints
- **Memory**: 8KB RAM limit requires careful resource management
- **Timing**: 1ms real-time polling requirement for parallel port
- **Hardware**: Specific shield configurations must be validated

### Testing Strategy
1. **Build Verification**: Ensure clean compilation
2. **Component Isolation**: Test each manager independently
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify inter-component communication
4. **Hardware Validation**: Test with actual hardware
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate timing and memory requirements
