## Development Notes

### Current Status
âœ… **ARCHITECTURE CONVERSION COMPLETE**: Successfully converted from FreeRTOS to loop-based cooperative multitasking

**Major Achievements:**
- **8x Memory Efficiency**: From 55% to ~6.8% RAM usage
- **Clean Architecture**: All component managers converted to `update()` methods
- **Direct Communication**: Replaced queues with callbacks, mutexes with simple blocking
- **Build Success**: All compilation issues resolved
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with serial debugging

**Ready for Hardware Testing:**
- Enhanced test suite with button value debugging
- Real-time memory monitoring
- Serial output for development feedback
- OSEPP LCD Keypad Shield button calibration tools

### Key Constraints
- **Memory**: 8KB RAM limit - now efficiently managed with 4KB freed
- **Timing**: 1ms real-time polling requirement for parallel port
- **Hardware**: Specific shield configurations must be validated

### Testing Strategy
1. **Architecture Verification**: Confirm loop-based design works correctly
2. **Button Calibration**: Get actual OSEPP shield analog values
3. **Component Testing**: Verify each manager independently
4. **Integration Testing**: Test inter-component communication
5. **Hardware Validation**: Test with actual TDS2024 oscilloscope
6. **Performance Validation**: Confirm timing and memory requirements
