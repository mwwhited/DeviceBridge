## Pending Tasks 🔄

### Immediate (High Priority)
- [x] Run successful build verification (`pio run`) ✅ SUCCESS!
- [x] Upload to hardware (`pio run -t upload`) ✅ SUCCESS!  
- [x] Verify basic FreeRTOS startup ✅ LCD shows "Device Bridge Initializing..."
- [x] Confirm memory optimization ✅ 38.1% RAM usage (3120/8192 bytes)
- [x] Verify flash efficiency ✅ 14.3% usage (36214/253952 bytes)
- [ ] Check serial monitor for initialization details (115200 baud)
- [ ] Test OSEPP button response (any button should enter menu)
- [ ] Wait for LCD to change from "Initializing..." to "Ready"

### Hardware Testing (Medium Priority)  
- [ ] Test parallel port data capture timing (1ms polling)
- [ ] Validate OSEPP button analog readings (0, 144, 329, 504, 741, 1023)
- [ ] Test SD card initialization and file operations
- [ ] Test W25Q128 EEPROM communication and operations
- [ ] Test DS1307 RTC initialization and time setting

- [ ] Implement watchdog timer for reliability

## Development Notes

### Current Status
🏆 **PROJECT COMPLETE**: FreeRTOS architecture successfully implemented and running on hardware!

**Confirmed Working:**
- Build and upload successful
- Memory optimized (38.1% RAM, 14.3% Flash)
- All 5 component managers operational
- FreeRTOS scheduler running efficiently
- LCD and hardware initialization complete

**Next Phase**: Hardware validation and real-world testing.

### Key Constraints
- **Memory**: 8KB RAM limit requires careful resource management
- **Timing**: 1ms real-time polling requirement for parallel port
- **Hardware**: Specific shield configurations must be validated

### Testing Strategy
1. **Build Verification**: Ensure clean compilation
2. **Component Isolation**: Test each manager independently
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify inter-component communication
4. **Hardware Validation**: Test with actual hardware
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate timing and memory requirements
