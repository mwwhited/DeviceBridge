- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: 11.3% RAM usage (8x improvement from original design)

**All major development phases completed. Previous task history archived to CHANGES.PHASE2.md**

## Pending Tasks

### **Hardware Testing** (High Priority)
- [ ] **Test LPT printer protocol** with TDS2024 using `testlpt` command
- [ ] **Test automatic L1/L2 LED behavior** during actual data capture and file writes
- [ ] **Menu Navigation Testing** - Verify LCD button navigation with calibrated values
- [ ] **Storage Failover Testing** - Verify SD → EEPROM → Serial fallback works

### **Advanced Features** (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Component Self-Tests** - Individual validation methods for each manager
- [ ] **Configuration EEPROM** - Save/restore settings via serial menu
- [ ] **Serial File Management** - list, get, delete commands for file operations

### **Optional Enhancements** (Low Priority)  
- [ ] **Service Locator Pattern** - Centralized component communication
- [ ] **LittleFS Integration** - Replace EEFS with LittleFS for EEPROM
- [ ] **Configuration Injection** - Dependency injection pattern
- [ ] Test parallel port data capture timing optimization (1ms polling)
- [ ] Test storage failover mechanisms under stress (SD → EEPROM → Serial)
- [ ] Test menu system navigation with calibrated buttons
- [ ] Test system recovery from error conditions
- [ ] Validate timing requirements for high-throughput capture
- [ ] Implement file type detection based on header bytes (beyond current auto-detection)
- [ ] Add file compression for storage efficiency
- [ ] Optimize parallel port read performance with hardware features
- [ ] Add hardware flow control support for parallel port communication
- [ ] Test SD card reliability under continuous writes and storage stress

### **Documentation Maintenance** (Low Priority)
- [ ] Create user manual for LCD menu system operation
- [ ] Document button calibration procedures
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures for hardware issues
- [ ] Create TDS2024 integration guide with format selection
- [ ] Add API documentation for component interfaces
- [ ] Create comprehensive troubleshooting guide for hardware issues

### **Hardware Enhancements** (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Interrupt-Based Capture** - If parallel port strobe pin supports interrupts, implement interrupt-driven capture
- [ ] **Pin Optimization** - Evaluate moving strobe to interrupt-capable pin for better responsiveness

### Future Enhancements (Backlog)
- [ ] Implement EEPROM file system operations with wear leveling
- [ ] Add USB serial transfer protocol for high-speed data transfer
- [ ] Implement configuration save/restore to EEPROM
- [ ] Add enhanced file type detection algorithms beyond header analysis
- [ ] Optimize memory usage further if needed (currently 11.3% is excellent)
- [ ] Add LED status indicators for visual feedback (heartbeat LED implemented)
- [ ] Implement watchdog timer for reliability
- [ ] Add web interface for remote management via ESP32 module
- [ ] Implement automatic file naming with timestamps (partially implemented)

### **Documentation Reminders** (Ongoing)
- [ ] Always update ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGES.md, TODO.md and CLAUDE.md when steps complete
- [ ] Use PlantUML diagrams (not ASCII art or mermaid) for technical diagrams

## Development Notes

### Current Status
✅ **ARCHITECTURE CONVERSION COMPLETE**: Successfully converted from FreeRTOS to loop-based cooperative multitasking

**Major Achievements:**
- **8x Memory Efficiency**: From 55% to ~6.8% RAM usage
- **Clean Architecture**: All component managers converted to `update()` methods
- **Direct Communication**: Replaced queues with callbacks, mutexes with simple blocking
- **Build Success**: All compilation issues resolved
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with serial debugging

**Ready for Hardware Testing:**
- Enhanced test suite with button value debugging
- Real-time memory monitoring
- Serial output for development feedback
- OSEPP LCD Keypad Shield button calibration tools

### Key Constraints
- **Memory**: 8KB RAM limit - now efficiently managed with 4KB freed
- **Timing**: 1ms real-time polling requirement for parallel port
- **Hardware**: Specific shield configurations must be validated

### Testing Strategy
1. **Architecture Verification**: Confirm loop-based design works correctly
2. **Button Calibration**: Get actual OSEPP shield analog values
3. **Component Testing**: Verify each manager independently
4. **Integration Testing**: Test inter-component communication
5. **Hardware Validation**: Test with actual TDS2024 oscilloscope
6. **Performance Validation**: Confirm timing and memory requirements
