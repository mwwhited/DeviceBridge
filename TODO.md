### Testing Strategy
1. **Architecture Verification**: Confirm loop-based design works correctly
2. **Button Calibration**: Get actual OSEPP shield analog values
3. **Component Testing**: Verify each manager independently
4. **Integration Testing**: Test inter-component communication
5. **Hardware Validation**: Test with actual TDS2024 oscilloscope
6. **Performance Validation**: Confirm timing and memory requirements
