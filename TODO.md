### **Medium Priority** (Feature Enhancements)
- [ ] **Refactor file system** - create interface for each file system supported by FileSystemManager
- [ ] **Refactor each filesystem** to its own class with proper separation
- [ ] **Import supported file systems** into FileSystemManager with modular design
- [ ] **Add serial configuration interface** - ability to set all configuration from serial

- [ ] Test menu system navigation with calibrated buttons
- [ ] Test system recovery from error conditions
- [ ] Validate timing requirements for high-throughput capture
- [ ] Implement file type detection based on header bytes (beyond current auto-detection)
- [ ] Add file compression for storage efficiency
- [ ] Optimize parallel port read performance with hardware features
- [ ] Add hardware flow control support for parallel port communication
- [ ] Test SD card reliability under continuous writes and storage stress

- [ ] Document button calibration procedures
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures for hardware issues
- [ ] Create TDS2024 integration guide with format selection
- [ ] Add API documentation for component interfaces
- [ ] Create comprehensive troubleshooting guide for hardware issues

### **Hardware Enhancements** (Low Priority)

### Future Enhancements (Backlog)
- [ ] Implement EEPROM file system operations with wear leveling
- [ ] Add USB serial transfer protocol for high-speed data transfer
- [ ] Implement configuration save/restore to EEPROM
- [ ] Add enhanced file type detection algorithms beyond header analysis
- [ ] Optimize memory usage further if needed (currently 11.3% is excellent)
- [ ] Add LED status indicators for visual feedback (heartbeat LED implemented)
- [ ] Implement watchdog timer for reliability
- [ ] Add web interface for remote management via ESP32 module
- [ ] Implement automatic file naming with timestamps (partially implemented)

### **Documentation Reminders** (Ongoing)
- [ ] Always update ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGES.md, TODO.md and CLAUDE.md when steps complete
- [ ] Use PlantUML diagrams (not ASCII art or mermaid) for technical diagrams
