### **üõ°Ô∏è Bulletproof Error Handling** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Self-Tests**: Enhanced hardware validation (LCD, parallel port, memory, config)
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Validation Cleanup**: Removed redundant child validations since ServiceLocator handles all
- ‚úÖ **Null Pointer Protection**: ServiceLocator validates all registrations with SOS error signaling
- ‚úÖ **Professional Error Handling**: HeartbeatLEDManager with SOS pattern (...---...) and serial error messages

### **üíæ SD Card Hot-Swap Capability** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Detection**: 1-second polling using hardware SD_CD pin for card presence
- ‚úÖ **Smart Re-initialization**: Automatic `initializeSD()` when card inserted after being missing
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Storage Switching**: Returns to preferred SD storage when card becomes available
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Removal Handling**: Safe file closure and fallback to EEPROM/Serial storage
- ‚úÖ **User Feedback**: LCD display and serial messages for insertion/removal events

### **üêõ Critical Bug Fixes** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **TDS2024 File Creation Bug**: Fixed isNewFile flag timing preventing file creation
- ‚úÖ **Compilation Error Fixes**: ParallelPortManager self-test corrections with proper Port interface
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Service Integration**: Added proper includes to resolve incomplete type errors
- ‚úÖ **Error Signal Management**: Immediate TDS2024 error communication with smart recovery

### **üîß Previous Foundation Work** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Service Locator Pattern**: Professional dependency management with runtime validation
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Centralization**: All 72+ magic numbers moved to ConfigurationService
- ‚úÖ **Buffer Management**: Multi-tier adaptive flow control with emergency recovery
- ‚úÖ **Debug System**: Comprehensive parallel port logging and real-time monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Perfect Data Integrity**: 30,280 bytes verified capture with zero data loss
