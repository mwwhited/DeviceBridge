### BMP Data Loss Analysis: COMPREHENSIVE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION ⭐⭐⭐ ✅
**Complete timing analysis and optimization recommendations completed (2025-07-20)**:

#### **Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Insufficient Data Setup Time**: 3μs hardware delay too short for TDS2024 data stability
2. **ACK Pulse Recognition**: 15μs ACK pulse may be insufficient for reliable TDS2024 communication
3. **Flow Control Thresholds**: 60%/80% thresholds too conservative, allowing pressure buildup
4. **Race Conditions**: Interrupt handler gaps when buffer approaches full capacity
5. **File Boundary Timing**: 2-second timeout creates data loss windows during file transitions

#### **Critical Timing Optimizations Identified**:
- **Hardware Delay**: Increase from 3μs → 5μs for TDS2024 data stability
- **ACK Pulse Width**: Extend from 15μs → 20μs for better recognition
- **Flow Control**: Tighter thresholds (50% moderate, 70% critical vs current 60%/80%)
- **Pre-Warning**: Add 40% threshold for early flow control
- **Interrupt Priority**: Enhanced data capture prioritization over flow control

#### **Buffer Management Issues**:
- **Interrupt Disable Windows**: Long readData() operations cause missed strobe pulses
- **State Transition Gaps**: Brief periods where busy signal cleared between flow states
- **File Header Loss**: Buffer clearing during timeouts loses start of next file data

#### **Implementation Ready**: All optimizations designed for ConfigurationService integration
