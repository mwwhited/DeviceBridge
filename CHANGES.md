## Development Guidelines

### **Change Documentation Requirements**
When adding new features or modifications:
1. **Document the change** with clear before/after descriptions
2. **Include implementation details** for technical reference
3. **Note any breaking changes** or compatibility impacts
4. **Update version status** and production readiness
5. **Test and verify** all functionality before marking complete

### **Version Control**
- Use semantic versioning principles
- Tag major milestones and production releases
- Maintain clear commit messages with change context
- Document any architectural or interface changes
